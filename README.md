# ad-block

### what is this?
a magisk module to update hosts files  automatically (kind of ad-away via shell)

### why?
I have my custom mods, this is "sandard" enought to be a public module

### how it works?
the defautl config is based od [StevenBlack's hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), it contains:
<ul>
<li>alternates/porn</li>
<li>alternates/social</li>
<li>alternates/fakenews</li>
<li>alternates/gambling</li>
</ul>

you can customize the list editing **/data/adb/modules/ad-block/ad-block.txt** file

or

adding your custom **ad-block.txt** file (with your hosts list) in root folder of internam memory.


it is designed to run once a day


that's all.
